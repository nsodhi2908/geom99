	<h1>Places I would love to visit in Canada.</h1>

<p>There are many reasons why humans have loved to travel over the centuries.<br>
From discovering new lands to interacting with different peoples and learning about their culture, travel really does broaden the mind.<br>

Gustave Flaubert said, "Travel makes one modest, you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world."<br>
<br>
Following markers represent the places I would love to travel to, in Canada. Click on the red marker to know about the places of my interest.</p>
